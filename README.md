# Hurricane analysis
This is a Python challenge project from Codecademy.
I don't know if I should be embarrassed for how long it took me to solve some problems (1 or 2 days), or proud of me because I managed to solve them without losing my mind (at least not entirely).

Songs I listened to during my coding sessions: Some kind of game by Agains all logic; All in your eyes by Harvey & The Phenomenals; Boring angel by Oneohtrix Point Never; Speak in Symphony by Tourist.
